# Compiler development — 2026-11-02

The scalar/string task is complete for its initial scope. Exact slice-assignment
promotion passes live checks; structured control flow is next under C004.

## C003 accepted and removed from TODO

Live checks pass baseline39/15 (31.456s), slice-write example (31.166s), ABI
(1.016s), 11-string/three-integer raw memory (41.772s), strings (25.561s),
search/repeat (38.786s), slices (38.289s), limits (49.105s), core/slice ABI
(1.032s/1.077s) and conversions (64.815s). Full prototype27/19 native/eight
rejected remains separately frozen. Exact compiler SHA928a46a060fa8b72dbbbc40484561c67b6736ba5cf69eaa7ced932e5409a8617
and 623-byte/two-relocation runtime are promoted; numeric vendor/adapter unchanged.

C003 is accepted for its initial scalar/string scope, with ownership, bounds,
no-allocation slice writes, deterministic output and prior regressions qualified.
Removed C003 from the sole TODO. Arrays/I/O remain C005 and LOCAL C004.
The Author authorized checkpointing and continuing without prior approval stops.
No Oryx contact, human/hardware validation or benchmark is claimed.
