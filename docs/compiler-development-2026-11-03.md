# Compiler development — 2026-11-03

The compact compiler now completes source layout inside executable RAM, but its
mandatory initialization storage cannot fit beside that executable. Retain the
measured layout and reduce private storage/code further; no native compiler or
self-hosting result exists yet. Pi5 automated CLI work is authorized; Oryx stays
offline and no physical test is implied.

## Actual compact-source layout and allocation bound

Exact2f81c6fb completes layout339291 bytes, body265236 (prior body390190), with
2078 symbols/213 definitions/254 bindings. Private heap limitA7F00 leaves86437
bytes. Handwritten inventory of its exact typed DIM shapes and pinned assembled
templates gives112761 mandatory payload bytes before array headers, owned string
contents and allocation overhead: a26324-byte minimum deficit. It cannot initialize.
After phase2 begins, deliberately stop only the owned CLI rather than spend two
further passes writing that unusable image. Controller1366.536s is a partial-run
measurement, not successful compile time. Original output remains unchanged.
compact-source-001 retains raw failure/log/source/provenance and an explicit
layout/disposition/bound record. No output pass, native initialization or native
compiler generation is claimed.

## Private zero-tail qualification

Prepared14e56cee stores465 initialized control bytes and streams the unchanged
8192-byte zero tail. Template storage saves8192 and source text19104 bytes;
actual native fit is not inferred. Start nine actual-reference/native cases,
requiring complete output identity with2f81c6fb. All runtime capacity, public
numeric/string semantics and original control-image bytes remain unchanged.

Zero-tail14e56cee passes nine native programs118.267s against actual BBC outputs,
repeat/GNU and all nine complete2f81c6fb images. Freeze zero-tail-frontend-001.
Refine bounded private symbol packing (three-byte addresses/two-byte sorted
indices) and sparse reusable numbered-target pages in COMPACTION.md before
implementation. Accepted source-program numbers/types and capacities do not change.

## Packed private tables and sparse target pages

Prepared6597a0df has2067 lines/219 distinct definitions. It keeps4096 symbols,
storing addresses in exact three-byte cells and sorted indices in two-byte cells
(12288 payload bytes saved). A64-pointer table owns reusable256-byte target
pages, preserving separate branch/DATA domains through65279. Pages allocate and
zero on first write and clear/reuse on subsequent compilations; maximum page
payload16384 bytes, pointer payload256. Static zero-page mandatory payload is
76153 bytes before headers/string contents and future page allocations.

The first nine-source attempt produces all nine images identical to2f81c6fb,
but the host-only BBC map observer accesses the removed saddr% array and fails
at540. Freeze packed-map-observer-failure-001, excluding stale native/results.
Change the observer to call the actual BBC getter for packed candidates; it
still never computes source addresses in Python. Unchanged6597a0df then passes
nine actual-reference/native programs123.659s, repeat, GNU standard/complete
compact links and all nine complete-image comparisons (packed-frontend-002).
A prepared actual-reference/native fixture uses the exact six private BBC helper
routines, all4096 cells with guards, all64 target pages,2047/2048 and65279 bits,
branch/DATA separation and repeated clears/reuse. This helper test is active;
no helper-capacity, actual fit or native compiler result is claimed yet.

packed-helpers-001 passes262.754s: actual BBC and actual native execution of the
exact six new helpers plus FNlineref exercise all4096 address/index cells with
four canaries, all64 pages,2047/2048/65279, domain separation, clear/rewrite and
pointer reuse. Deterministic output and GNU NUM/STR/complete compact module pass;
complete control/ACT/MEM/ERR runtimes, bridges, entry, arena and heap context also
independently match. This is native helper behavior, not a native compiler image.

Numbered-target first oracle used line0, which the pinned text loader executes
immediately during loading (OSEDIT/LNZERO selects XEQ), before later targets
exist. Retain the failed reference-only attempt; no compiler/native phase ran.
Clarify this existing compiler-label syntax boundary in SPEC/COMPAT/findings.
Positive conventional targets2047/2048/65279 and combined branch/DATA labels now
match two fresh BASIC oracles; separate compiler-zero-label fixture prints2.
Two undefined top-line targets reject before output. packed-targets-002 passes
five cases/three native58.636s, repeat and GNU numeric links. Full packed
baseline39/15 also passes56.360s including GNU golden and repeat. These are
controller durations, not Agon speed benchmarks. C005 source errors/capacity and
actual native fit remain open; the next source probe adds BBC-only observations
of allocated target pages and private string lengths after layout, preserving
its exact target source and keeping host instrumentation separate.

## Isolated promotion packaging rehearsal

Push packed checkpoint4575516 and start exact packed-source-001 with BBC-only
page/string observations. Separately stage the future source/runtime/tool tree
under C005/build; live source stays7cac4bba. Add a private control-prefix package
while retaining the full independently linked image, preserve following64000
DATA when repacking errors, and prepare the394-byte adapter at its future live
paths. All nine packages rebuild identical complete runtime bytes, combined
regeneration exactly reproduces6597a0df, and each individual repacker preserves
that full source. Extended rehearsal also preserves the old7cac4bba compiler
through the modified control/error packers. promotion-preparation-002 retains
both rehearsal identities, exact staged changes, source and module data. No live
promotion, emulator change or actual native fit is implied by packaging success.
