# BBC BASIC native compiler project handoff

Read `/Agon/mystuff/agon-dev-env/codex/AGENTS.md` first. That directory owns
shared environment, ownership, assembly and emulator instructions.

This working repository contains the reference BASIC V ADL interpreter and a
experimental compiler under `docs/tasks/C001/`. `compiler/` currently holds
project documents; no compiler implementation has been promoted to live code.
Keep interpreter changes separate from compiler work. The active compiler
branch is `codex/native-bbc-compiler`.

Read `compiler/README.md`, `compiler/SPECIFICATION.md`,
`compiler/COMPATIBILITY.md`, `compiler/REFERENCE.md`, and the latest
`docs/compiler-development-*.md` log before changing compiler behavior. The
compiler is BBC BASIC; Python may orchestrate tests but must not implement the
compiler or substitute another numeric representation.

`TODO.md` is the only unfinished-work list. Each immutable ID maps to
`docs/tasks/<ID>.md`; experimental scripts and code belong in
`docs/tasks/<ID>/`. Read `docs/tasks/README.md` for the accepted lifecycle and
`docs/tasks/C000.md` / `docs/tasks/C001.md` for the retrospective records.
Task briefs own scope and acceptance criteria; dated logs own chronological
evidence. Passing experiments can be promoted to live source with the evidence
and destination recorded in the task document. Do not treat placement or an
automated test pass as human emulator validation or commit approval.

C001 has passed automated qualification and remains experimental. C002–C006
are broad, unstarted task briefs, to be refined before implementation. This
documentation and relocation request does not start any further language work.

Use `.venv/bin/python` explicitly. `compiler/README.md` contains build/test
commands. `.emulator/` is an ignored automated CLI fixture, not a graphical
human review instance. No graphical emulator or hardware has been deployed.
Leave changes uncommitted pending the Author's review and the canonical
emulator validation policy.
